    "question": "Why my cars oil is leaking",
    "answer": "Based on the provided information, your oil leak is likely caused by worn gaskets or a cracked oil pan.  I cannot provide further diagnosis or repair steps without more information.",
    "feedback": "helpful",
    "correction": "sometimes its due to An engine oil leak occurs when oil escapes the sealed confines of the engine, often caused by worn or damaged gaskets and seals, a loose or damaged oil drain plug, a cracked oil pan, or an improperly installed oil filter."

    "question": "Why my engine is overheating",
    "answer": "Your engine overheating could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Low coolant level:** Check your coolant level.  If low, add coolant (following the correct procedure for your vehicle; consult your owner's manual).  **Safety Note:** Allow the engine to cool completely before checking coolant levels. Hot coolant can cause serious burns.\n\n2. **Dirty or leaking coolant:** Inspect your coolant for dirt, sediment, or leaks. Dirty coolant can clog the radiator. Leaks require professional repair.\n\n3. **Faulty thermostat:** A faulty thermostat can prevent coolant from circulating properly. This requires professional diagnosis and replacement.\n\n4. **Broken radiator fan:** A malfunctioning radiator fan prevents sufficient cooling.  This requires professional diagnosis and repair.\n\n5. **Clogged radiator:** A clogged radiator restricts coolant flow.  This usually requires professional cleaning or replacement.\n\n\nThe provided information also mentions worn piston rings, leaks in the combustion system, and warped cylinders as potential causes of overheating.  However, diagnosing these issues requires a more in-depth inspection and is beyond the scope of this simple troubleshooting.  I recommend having a qualified mechanic inspect your vehicle if the above steps don't resolve the overheating.",

    "answer": "Engine overheating can be caused by several factors:\n\n1. **Low coolant level:** Check the coolant level in the radiator and overflow tank.  *Safety Note: Allow the engine to cool completely before checking coolant levels to avoid burns.*  If low, add coolant of the correct type.\n\n2. **Dirty or leaking coolant:** Inspect the coolant for debris or discoloration. Look for leaks around the radiator, hoses, water pump, and engine block. *Safety Note:  Wear gloves when handling coolant as it can be corrosive.*\n\n3. **Faulty thermostat:** A malfunctioning thermostat can prevent proper coolant flow.  This requires professional diagnosis and replacement.\n\n4. **Broken radiator fan:** Check if the radiator fan is working correctly when the engine is hot.  This also needs professional evaluation and repair.\n\n5. **Clogged radiator:** A clogged radiator restricts coolant flow. This often results from dirty coolant (see point 2).  Professional cleaning or replacement may be necessary.\n\n6. **Worn piston rings or leaks in the combustion system:** These are internal engine problems causing overheating.  They require a mechanic's diagnosis and repair.  *Safety Note: Attempting these repairs yourself can be dangerous.*\n\n7. **Warped cylinders:**  This is a serious engine problem resulting from overheating. It requires professional repair.",
